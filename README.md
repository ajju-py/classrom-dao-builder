# Classroom DAO Builder

## Project Description
Classroom DAO Builder is a simple decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) contract written in Clarity for managing classroom proposals and votes. Users can create proposals related to classroom decisions and other participants can vote for or against these proposals.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to empower educational communities to make transparent and collective decisions through blockchain technology. The Classroom DAO Builder aims to bring democratic decision-making into classrooms by using smart contracts to manage proposals and voting fairly and transparently.

## Future Scope
- Add proposal execution functionality to automatically carry out decisions.
- Introduce delegation of votes.
- Implement quorum and voting periods for proposals.
- Integrate token-based voting weight for more advanced governance.
- Add role-based access control for admins or teachers.
- Provide detailed analytics on voting results.

## Contract Address
This contract can be deployed on the Stacks blockchain. The address will be available post-deployment.
